  description: The gene has been manually annotated by the Havana group but the design of a conditional allele has not been possible. Reasons for this may include the absence of frame-shifting (critical) exons, the introns flanking critical exons are too small, too few exons (our vector design strategy requires the presence of at least two exons), etc. Requests are usually put on hold in this status unless other designs (e.g. deletion alleles) are specified.
